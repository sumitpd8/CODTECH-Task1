# Password Strength Checker
# Overview of the Project 
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the security strength of passwords. It assesses passwords against several criteria to determine their robustness and provides immediate feedback to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.

Features
Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Digit Inclusion: Verifies the presence of at least one numerical digit.
Uppercase Letters: Checks for at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Letters: Ensures there is at least one lowercase letter.
Special Characters: Confirms the inclusion of at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
Feedback: Provides detailed feedback on how to improve the password strength.
Strength Classification: Classifies passwords into categories such as "Very Strong", "Strong", "Moderate", and "Weak".

How It Works
The Password Strength Checker uses regular expressions to validate the different criteria for a strong password. Based on the number of criteria met, it scores the password and provides corresponding feedback and classification.
